# E-Library Web App Platform Proposal

This is a proposal for a web app platform aimed at addressing the issue of inadequate library resources for students. The platform is specifically designed for government secondary schools and targets students in SS1-SS3.

## Project Overview

The project is currently in the prototype phase and does not include the full system of the proposed platform. It focuses on showcasing the UI/UX designs for the first stage of the platform.
